Wrinkles reflected from the old mirror
Hair transformed into difference color
Fragrance faded away long time ago
Nothing remain for dreaming about love

Hence freeze warm heart in the winter
Rely on children for completing Three Obediences
Either acquit oneself of faith
Or share mourning to universe
